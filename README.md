AngularJS coding assignments inspired by the CodeAcademy course

#### The Best Sellers page
- My first AngularJS page. It contains
  - a main page that includes
    - a new module and
    - a controller with a data structure and two functions 

Web page pulls Amazon's top 10 selling books in 2015 and displays them.  
It also implements functions to add likes/dislikes for every book.
#### The Clash page
- In addition to previously introduced, the assignment contains custom made directive(s)

Web page shows short bios (taken from wikipedia) of the four most important members of the band The Clash.
#### Weather22 page
- The assignment introduces the usage of a service

From the http://www.openweathermap.org/ , using their API key (you have to register on the website in order to get one...it's free) I am showing the most recent weather information for the largest 22 cities (by population) in the world.  
Data is received in JSON format.  
The units are metric.
